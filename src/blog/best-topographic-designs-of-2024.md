# Photo of Topographic Calendar

Here we see [Cody](https://dribbble.com/shots/4051011-NST-Desktop-Calendar-Detail) who has taken a photo of his Desktop Calendar.
The topography map is the real map of the North Short Title area, which makes it special and local.
This showcases very well how one can use topography in design to get a local feel.

# Save the Date Invitation

[Sara](https://dribbble.com/shots/6277051-Save-The-Date) has used a topographic background for her save the date invitation.
What is really cool with this is it uses letterpress for the topography, which creates a depth to the design.

# Horsetooth Mountain Print

Here [Patric](https://dribbble.com/shots/3259136-Horsetooth-Mountain-Topo) has made a screen print of his local mountain.
A really detailed topographic map can be really interesting visually.
It also gives the local feel since it is a map of an actual local place.
